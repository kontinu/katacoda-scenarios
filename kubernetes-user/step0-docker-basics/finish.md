Congratulations! Hope you found this lesson useful.


Docker is even more than what you did in this training session, here is a few other things that you can do with docker:

- Build images using multi-stage builds
- Run containers in a single node.
- Run multiple containers or even a multi-container app in a single node using docker-compose.
- configure applications using environment variables or .env file.
- scan images for vulnerabilities (docker + snyk)
- Orchestrate containers in a multi node scenario using its own container orchestration solution (Docker Swarm)
- Load Balance ingress traffic using Routing Mesh solution.
- many more !
